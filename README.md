## ❖・Introduction・❖

This assignment requires that you create a basic, three-page web site about you or someone else, fictitious or real.

---

## ❖・Directions・❖

* You may **not** use any libraries, such as Bootstrap, for this assignment.
* The three pages required for this assignment, `index.html`, `contact.html`, and `about.html`, are already included. Write you code in *only* these files.
* The `index` page must contain some basic information about you/your subject. A paragraph will suffice.
* The `index` page must also contain an image of you/your subject. It may be `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, or `.svg` and cannot be larger than 1MB in size. It *must* be placed in the `img` folder.
* The image file name must use lowercase, combined with kebab case. For example, `do-this` or `do-this.html`. Further, no spaces in folder or file names (`not this`); no camel case (`notThis`); and, no snake case (`not_this`).
* The `contact` page should contain a link to an email address and two links to social media platforms. Choose any social media platforms you please.
* The `about` page should extend on the intro content found on the `index` page, perhaps adding one or two paragraphs.
* Each of the three pages must contain a simple navigation that allows users to navigate between all three pages.
* All pages must use, at the bare minimum, the following elements: `header`, `nav`, `main`, `p`, `a`, `img` and elements from the outlining algorithm.
* The `title` and the `meta name="description"` elements must observe SEO best practices, as discussed in class, and must differ for each of the three pages.
* Your HTML must be valid, per the [HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
